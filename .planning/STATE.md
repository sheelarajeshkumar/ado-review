### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from 29 requirements -- shell/auth, pipeline, multi-provider, intelligence/history
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 keeps ADO + LLM integration together as one end-to-end pipeline (cannot verify independently)
- [Roadmap]: Auth (ADO-02, ADO-03) placed in Phase 1 because Phase 2 pipeline depends on working auth
